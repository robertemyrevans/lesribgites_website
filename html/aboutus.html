    <h2>About Us</h2>

<a href="javascript:openWin('../images/Lunch at Jasmine.jpg');"><img class="feature" height="220" src="../images/Lunch at Jasmine.jpg" border="0" alt="Lunch at Jasmine"></a>

<p>Welcome to <span class="fun">Les Ribaudi&egrave;res</span>, our gite complex in the sunny Charente Maritime.  If you are looking for a relaxing holiday where you can unwind in beautiful surroundings, or perhaps something a little more energetic, then this is the place for you.</p>

<p>Both of our character gites have been renovated  to a high standard, whilst retaining many original features, such as oak beams and stonework. Sunset and Jasmine each has its own private pool. Each gite has a private courtyard, with table and chairs set out under its own shady, vine covered pergola - perfect for outdoor eating and drinking.</p>


<p class="short_line"><span class="fun">Les Ribaudi&egrave;res</span> is a hamlet set in the heart of beautiful countryside. It is very peaceful, with varied wildlife, great for bird watchers and nature lovers generally.  Although in a very rural setting, all amenities can be found only a 10 minute drive away in the historic town of St Jean d'Angely. It has a twice weekly market (great cheese, fish and vegetable stalls), supermarkets, restaurants, banks and other shops.</p>


<a href="javascript:openWin('../images/Sunrise_and_pool.jpg');"><img class="feature" height="220" src="../images/Sunrise_and_pool.jpg" border="0" alt="Sunrise and Pool"></a>

  
   <p>For the more energetic, the quiet country roads and gently rolling landscape are great for walking and cycling. We have numerous bikes of various sizes, available free of charge. There are tennis courts at Tonnay Boutonne (about 10 minutes away) and a swimming complex and boating lake (with canoes, pedaloes, mini golf and the like) at St Jean d'Angely.</p>
  
<p>We are close to a number of 18 hole Golf courses; Saintes, Cognac and Royan are specially recommended. Booking is easy, and green fees are reasonable. The courses are attractive and the weather is generally good.</p>


<p>If you are looking for a day at the beach, we are just 35 minutes away from lovely beaches  like Fouras and Chatelaillon, and less than an hour from the beaches of St. Palais, Chatelaillon Plage, and the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;. Further day trip possiblities are La Rochelle, Cognac, Futuroscope and Royan; all within easy reach.</p>
