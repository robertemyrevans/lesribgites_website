			What a brilliant holiday we had - 12 fantastic nights in Jasmine (and we really needed a holiday!)

The gite was great, so well equipped!(I didn't need half the stuff I brought from home!) and the meal and wine on our first night was a wonderful idea and great value. The area is great for exploring. We went to La rochelle, Angouleme, Royan, but mainly we took advantage of the lovely weather and stayed by the pool.

We will be back - most probably to look for a holiday home in the area, as we loved it so much!

			Many thanks for a fantastic week. We really appreciated the little touches, like the wine and the toiletries.You have a fantastic spot here, we've loved the bike rides and driving to the gorgeous islands and Atlantic beaches and to La rochelle. 

Thanks also for the pool and inflatables, and the playthings too. We've had a brilliant time

			Thank you Dorothy and John. This is a wonderful location, unspoilt and very French! The weather was brilliant for the whole 2 weeks and we had lots of pool time, evening drinks and BBQ's on the terrace(s) with our friends who were staying in the other gite.

Your hospitality was second to none and we were very grateful for your help when our car broke down!

			Thank you very much for a wonderful week - fantastic location, wonderful hosts. Your help was invaluable - directions to and from places and suggestion for places to visit.  An amazing location - peaceful, beautiful and the fields of sunflowers were a real treat!  The children thoroughly enjoyed the pool with all the inflatables and the swings and slides - all very child friendly and all contributing to a wonderful week away.  Thank you for everything - we hope to see you again soon.All the best !!
