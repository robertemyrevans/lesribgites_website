<p>Some of you may be interested to know that two translations French friends have given for Les Ribaudieres are "trollop's house" or "poor people's place". We think the former sounds more interesting, of course. Whatever the name means, records show that the house was built around 200 years ago.</p>
  
<p>The closest supermarkets (Intermarche and LeClerc) and other shops can be found in either St Jean d'Angely or Surgeres. Apart from the supermarkets, most shops close for lunch from around 12 - 2pm even in the larger towns like La Rochelle.  Many shops are also closed on Mondays.</p>
  
<p>There will be a welcome pack in your kitchen when you arrive with a few essentials; milk, bread, butter etc. If you would like us to get any further shopping in for you, then please put your requirements on our booking form.  If you forget, then we can still get provisions for you if you contact us, but please give us at least a week's notice.</p>
  
<p>A bread van calls here 3 days a week; Friday, Saturday &amp; Sunday, so listen out for the mad beeping of a horn.</p>
  
<p>Your beds will be made up for your arrival and bedding (sheets, duvets, pillows, pillowcases) is included. Towels are also provided. If you are staying for more than one week, we will provide you with clean bedding and towels at the end of each week.</p>

<p>If you are travelling with a baby or toddler, we can provide you with a cot and baby bath free of charge. Please put your requirements on your booking form.</p>

<p>There is a washing machine for use by our guests in a separate utility room. We ask that you use this machine with consideration; in France, water is metered and there are frequent water shortages during the summer.   There is also an iron and ironing board.   Each gite has a clothes airer and pegs.</p>
