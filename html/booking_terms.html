Should you cancel after the final balance has been paid, we will attempt to re-let and, if successful, we will refund the full amount less the 25% deposit.&nbsp; If for any reason you wish to change your booking and another date is possible, a small administration fee of 15 euros will be charged.  But if this is not possible, the original holiday remains booked and cancellation conditions apply.&nbsp; You are strongly advised to take out a comprehensive travel insurance policy to include cancellation cover and to have full cover for the party’s personal belongings and public liability.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>GUESTS' RESPONSIBILITIES<br></b>&nbsp;<br><u>Security/Breakages deposit</u>  - A cheque for £100 (payable to R.J.
